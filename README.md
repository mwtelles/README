# <center>***HiðŸ‘‹, I am Matheus Telles***</center>
I am a Software Engineer graduated from Universidade de Vassouras in Brazil. At the moment I'm working with some languages like *Python*, *PHP* and *JavaScript*, but I like to say that a good developer has to be versatile, so I focus on quality and not on languages or frameworks.


I consider myself a smart worker and a collaborative team player. *Passionately curious* and I am always trying to innovate and undertake. I believe in *learning forever* and collaborative growth!
