# Greetings! üëã I'm Telles, The Engineer üöÄ

I‚Äôm not just a Software Engineer with over a decade of experience in programming, my journey extends beyond holding a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and a postgraduate specialization in Software Architecture. I delve into the digital depths, exploring and solving complex web phenomena ‚Äî from understanding browser intricacies to architecting scalable, innovative solutions.

In the realm of Front-End development, my expertise is not confined to mere aesthetics or functionality. Instead, it represents a harmonious fusion of both, propelled by my mastery of JavaScript, React, React Native, and Node.js. Here, I not only craft interfaces but also engineer experiences that resonate with users, setting new benchmarks in usability and design integration.

And don't worry, despite my deep dive into Front-End, I'm full-stack, so I understand more than just CSS jokes ‚Äî though I do appreciate a good `position: absolute` pun every now and then.

## Technical Specialization üõ†Ô∏è
`JavaScript Expert` | `React & React Native Authority` | `Node.js Specialist` | `Next.js Connoisseur`

Over my career, I've honed a precise set of skills that are at the heart of modern web development. I don't follow trends because of popularity; I master technologies that drive real-world solutions. My dedication to the JavaScript ecosystem has made me an expert in building scalable, high-performance applications with React, Node.js, and Next.js.

Programming is not just about following syntax; it's about thinking logically, solving problems, and understanding the architecture that produces high-quality software. This philosophy has guided my journey from a curious programmer to a JavaScript architect. My work is a testament to my commitment not just to code, but also to creating solutions that stand the test of time.

but as I say, a programmer knows how to program, so I don't limit myself to languages I just think about how to solve problems and I'm very good at that.

## Let's Connect and Build Together üîó
In the vast landscape of technology, conversation sparks innovation. I am open to discussions about programming, career development, job opportunities, and beyond. If you're intrigued by the prospect of working with someone deeply entrenched in the JavaScript ecosystem and passionate about crafting the future of web technology, I'm your guy.

Whether it‚Äôs for a project collaboration, mentorship, or a casual chat about the latest in tech, my digital door is always open. If you‚Äôre looking to hire or collaborate on a project, I‚Äôm eager to explore how we can turn ideas into reality.
